# epsilon_Fe2O3_controls

A Jupyter notebook for Exploratory Data Analysis using machine learning techniques. This was made as an exercise for GLY6932 (Data Science and Machine Learning Methods in the Geosciences) at University of Florida.


## Purpose

The purpose of this notebook is to explore which factors may be controlling the formation of Îµ-Fe2O3 in North American Clinker Deposits. To do this, I used machine learning techniques (Principal component analysis, K-means clustering, and a random forest classifier) via the scikit-learn library.
